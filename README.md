I was honestly tired of running the same docker command to be able to use the stremio server on my chromebook... 

Since stremios support for chromebooks is very limited (using the android app sucks), the docker image has to be used... Therefore, I decided to make a simple bash script that automates this process without having to type the same long command everytime i restart my chromebook..
